# Geotagging with Jetpack Compose in Android

This project demonstrates how to implement geotagging functionality in an Android app using Jetpack Compose. Geotagging allows users to tag photos or other media with geographical location data, which can be useful for applications like travel journals, social media, or location-based services.

# Overview

# Key Features

# Location Retrieval: 

* Uses the Android Location Services API to get the user's current geographical coordinates.
* UI with Jetpack Compose: Implements a responsive and intuitive user interface using Jetpack Compose components.
# Geotagging Integration: 
* Tags captured photos with location data and displays this information in the app.
# Permissions Handling: 
* Manages runtime permissions for accessing location services and storing photos.
# Prerequisites
* Android Studio Arctic Fox or later.
* Kotlin 1.6.0 or later.
